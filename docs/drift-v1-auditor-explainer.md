What is Governance Drift?
Governance drift refers to any material change in an organisation’s AI governance posture after a previously recorded evidence state.

How Veriscopic Detects Drift
Veriscopic generates cryptographically hashed evidence packs at defined points in time. Drift detection is performed by comparing canonical fields across successive evidence packs.

What Is Considered Drift (v1.0)

Changes to accepted legal documents

Changes to declared AI system purpose or data categories

Changes to governance accountability structure

What Is Not Claimed
Veriscopic does not infer intent, compliance, or legal correctness. It records and compares declared governance facts.

Why This Is Audit-Ready

Append-only records

Deterministic hashing

Reproducible verification

Time-anchored snapshots

“Most platforms tell you whether you’re compliant today. Veriscopic tells you whether anything has changed since you last proved it.”
